If X > Y:
	Print(fÓ{X} is greater than {Y}Ó)

#The above code is a simple conditional statement that compares two variables, X
#and Y, and prints out whether X is greater than or equal to Y

#This conditional furthermore shows that 3 is not great than 4, so
# the result of the condiitonal will be the printing of
# 3 is less than or equal to 4
